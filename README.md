# Facial-detection-and-functionallity-in-python

This repo contains, training material, dlib implementation and tensorflow implementation. 
Too large files (mostly models) is ignored due to Github limitations, the models can be found in github-repos linked in learning folder readme.


# Training Material
See folder learning
Here I show my learning process of facial detection and how to work with tensorflow and dlib.

# Dlib
See dlib folder
Here I share a singel and multi threaded dlib solution for facial detection and some functions like blink frequency and age/gender estimation.
I am using code from several other repos with my code here.

# Tensorflow
See tensorflow folder
Here I share a singel and multi threaded tensorflow solution for facial detection and some functions like skin_color.
I am using code from several other repos with my code here.

#Upcoming
I will add a test system with parseing-system for easier understanding and demo

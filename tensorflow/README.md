# TENSORFLOW
This `README`-file describe the content of this folder.

# YOLOv3 implementation
This folder contains an implementation of YOLO detection in keras and pure Tensorflow. YOLO detection is a fast and effective detection model.

Run `main.py` to start these implementation.

# Single-threaded implementation
This implementation uses tensorflow object detection on webcam stream.

Run `webcam_detection_with_tracking.py` to start implementation.

# Multi-threaded implementation
This implementation is very similar to the Single-threaded one but with multiple threads

Run `start.py` to start implementation
